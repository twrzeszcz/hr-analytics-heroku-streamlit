# General Info
This is an HR Analytics project based on the data taken from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/hr-analytics-job-change-of-data-scientists) where we have to predict if someone is going to change a job based on some features. Preprocessing and training is done in the **hr_prep_train** notebook. There is an interactive app [Streamlit]() (currently offline) where one can perform EDA on the train set, get some basic information about the data, evaluate model performance and display feature importances. There is also a prediction service where user can input data manually. Additionally the same inference service is deployed here [Heroku](https://hr-analytics-pred-service.herokuapp.com/predict).
